Quality Targets (Internal)

Aim to produce itineraries that feel practical, well-paced, and clear.
Keep plans detailed enough to be useful, but still simple and budget-friendly.
Include a few backup indoor or outdoor choices without overwhelming the user.
Stay away from jargon or anything that feels overly technical.
