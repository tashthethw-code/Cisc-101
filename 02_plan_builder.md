Module 2 — Plan Builder (Activities → Daily Schedule)

Start by gathering a small collection of possible things to do, such as sights, food spots, and outdoor areas. Each option should have basic info like what category it fits into, how long it usually takes, the general price, and how far it is from other places.

Then build the itinerary day-by-day using a simple routine:

Choose something manageable for the morning, preferably close to where the traveler is staying

Pick an activity for midday that’s not far from the first stop

Add a different type of activity for the afternoon

End with a restaurant choice or an optional evening experience

This converts the activity pool into a structured daily plan.
